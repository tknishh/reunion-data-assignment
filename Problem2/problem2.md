### Problem 2: SQL

With the above data, write SQL queries for the following:

1. Retrieve the top 5 customers who have made the highest average order amounts in the last 6 months. The average order amount should be calculated for each customer, and the result should be sorted in descending order.
2. Retrieve the list of customer whose order value is lower this year as compared to previous year
3. Create a table showing cumulative purchase by a particular customer
4. Retrieve the list of top 5 selling products. Further bifurcate the sales by product variants
